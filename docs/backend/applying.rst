Backend: Applying values and validating
=======================================

After receiving a JSON representing an updated state, the form can be used to apply the values
to an object::

  personForm(person).applyValuesFromJSON(receivedJson)

  // with validation:
  personForm(person).applyValuesFromJSON(receivedJson).doValidate()

The resulting type of each method is a ``FormWithObject[Person]``, which contains potential conversion/validation errors and the current state of the object.

If there are errors, the json generated by ``generateJSON`` will contain them, and the errors will be displayed to the client if the data is sent back to the client and rendered.
